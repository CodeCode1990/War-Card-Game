## ⚔ What is WAR? ⚔

**WAR** is a classic 2 players card game. Each player flips cards from their deck; whoever reveals the higher card wins both! But beware: if you draw the same card, it’s time for **WAR**—where the stakes (and the card pile) grow big, fast. Winner takes all, until one player reigns supreme. 🤺🔥

## ⚙️ Why I Made This Project
I created this WAR card game to:
- **Learn and practice object-oriented programming concepts** in Python
- Simulate a real-life card game and implement game logic (like war, tie-breakers, hand management)
- Hone my skills in user input handling, program flow, and managing program state
- Add my own twist to a classic, and have fun building something you can actually play with friends!
**What I Learned:**
- How to create and manipulate classes and objects in Python
- Effective use of lists and dictionaries
- Working with user input and real-time feedback
- The importance of managing game flow—especially with unpredictable scenarios (like ties or running out of cards)
